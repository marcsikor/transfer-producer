# Transfer producer

Below program uses python's tkinter module and LaTeX to produce a transfer print (in .pdf) used in traditional transfer orders - in polish and english - please note that some fragments of the translation and currency changes are still not implemented

Has been tested only on Linux and GNOME Desktop Environment (the program uses GNOME default pdf reader)

Please note that the files have to be in the same directory, or the path to the file has to be changed.
