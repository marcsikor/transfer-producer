# Transfer producer

Below program uses python's tkinter module and LaTeX (pdflatex required) to produce a transfer print (in .pdf) used in traditional transfer orders - in polish and english.

It supports dark mode and saving receivers/senders data (in csv formats)

Has been created Linux and GNOME Desktop Environment (the program uses GNOME default pdf reader) in mind, but it has been ported to Windows as well.

Please note that the files have to be in the same directory, or the path to the file has to be changed.
