# Transfer producer

Below program uses python's tkinter module and LaTeX (pdflatex required) to produce a transfer print (in .pdf) used in traditional transfer orders - in polish and english.

Has been created Linux and GNOME Desktop Environment (the program uses GNOME default pdf reader) in mind, but it has been ported to Windows as well - with a minor bug regarding styling of the currency "combobox" - the widget stays white on Windows version (at least in my testing). This issue is yet to be addressed.

Please note that the files have to be in the same directory, or the path to the file has to be changed.
